# Morris, Lobo, and Thompson

The names, *not necessarily respectively*, of the brakeman, fireman, and engineer of a certain train were Morris, Lobo, and Thompson. Three passengers on the train happened to have the same names and, in order to distinguish them from the railway employees, will be referred to hereafter as Mr. Morris, Mr. Lobo, and Mr. Thompson.

You know that:

  1. Mr. Thompson lives in Detroit.
  2. The brakeman lives halfway between Chicago and Detroit.
  3. Mr. Lobo earned exactly $80,000 per year.
  4. Morris beat the fireman at billiards.
  5. The brakeman’s next-door neighbour, one of the passengers, earns exactly three times as much as the brakeman.
  6. The passenger who lives in Chicago has the same name as the brakeman.

What was the name of the engineer?

Morris - 3
Lobo - 1
Thompson - 4

## The Solution

  1. Since Morris beats the fireman at billiards (4), Morris must be either the brakeman or the engineer.

  2. The brakeman, who lives halfway between Chicago and Detroit (2), also lives near the neighbor who earns three times as much as he does.

  3. The neighbor cannot be Mr. Thompson because Mr. Thompson lives in Detroit.

  4. The neighbor cannot be Mr. Lobo because Mr. Lobo’s $80,000 a year (3) is not evenly divisible by three.

  5. Therefore, the brakeman’s neighbor must be Mr. Morris.

  6. The passenger whose name is the same as the brakeman’s lives in Chicago.

  7. He cannot be Mr. Thompson because Mr. Thompson lives in Detroit (1). He cannot be Mr. Morris because Mr. Morris lives between Chicago and Detroit.

  8. Therefore, the passenger’s name is Mr. Lobo.

  9. Therefore, the brakeman’s name is also Lobo.

  10. Since Morris beats the fireman at billiards, the fireman must be Thompson.

The Engineer is Morris.
