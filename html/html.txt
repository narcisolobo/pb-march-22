HTML should be responsible for the structure of our website.
CSS should be responsible for the style of our website.
JS should be responsible for the functionality of our website.

Parts of an HTML tag:

1. HTML Element
2. Attribute(s) - Customizes the element
3. Value of Attribute - How we are customizing the element

<meta charset="UTF-8">
